# TheCodeCafe NeoVim Setup

A Personal practice done solely on the basis of curiosity and experimentation.

This is a hobby project for myself, I will not be maintaining this for the public so if you need
changes you will have to make them yourself, feel free to copy this code and make any change that
meets your needs.
